# Program Reflection:
Throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University I’ve enjoyed learning new skills while at the same time reinforcing previously gained knowledge. One class that was completely new to me was CS-330, Computer Graphics and Visualization. I had always been interested in computer graphics because of my interest in video games and animation, but I had never really looked into how those visuals were made. My experience in the class with OpenGL was an exciting one. I translated my skills with other object oriented programming languages and enhanced them with my newly discovered graphics programming to create interesting and complex 3D objects that utilize lighting and textures. This course really highlighted my skills as a software engineer by allowing me to recreate an object from my home office in 3D digital space, while having no prior experience with the language or graphics programming concepts needed to do so.

Another class that stuck with me at SNHU was my Data Structures and Algorithms class DAD-260. I went into this class with a good amount of exposure to programming and databases but not much in the way of algorithms. One of the things I really appreciated about this course is the in depth discussions on why certain algorithms are used in different scenarios. Seeing the advantages and disadvantages of a search algorithm fascinated me since I expected them to be mostly the same in every situation. Not only is the speed of the algorithm important but also the reliability and integrity of the data it returns. Learning how to utilize these different algorithms and when to use them has followed me through every class and into my professional life.

The class that has stuck with me the most in my professional life would be DAD-220, Intro to SQL. Before I started down my path at SNHU I had very little exposure to SQL. I lacked confidence and generally tried to avoid the subject when it came up. After my time in DAD-220 however, I have gained the skills to be confident in SQL and to maintain these skills I use SQL just about every day as a software engineer. This course helped cement the fundamentals of SQL in me and allowed me to expand upon them into more advanced, real world situations like utilizing stored procedures and writing custom queries to retrieve useful data from multiple databases.

While these three classes have stuck with me throughout my time as SNHU, they were not the only important exposures I gathered during my degree. I learned the basics of Python in CS 200. Developed my knowledge of the Software Development Lifecycle in CS-250. I learned the importance of automated testing and QA in CS-260 and how to code with security in mind and use static analysis tools to find vulnerabilities in CS 405. I was exposed to Linux in IT-255, and reinforced my understanding of object oriented programming in IT-315. My skills in networking were sharpened in IT-340, Networking & Telecommunication Management, and I learned how to protect those systems from outside attacks in IT-380, Cybersecurity & Information Assurance. The knowledge gained during this degree was not just limited to computer science and information technology. I also completed several math courses including, calculus and discrete mathematics, Studied history in applied history, practiced the laws of physics in my Principles of Physics class and lab, and examined the effects of technology on society in IDS-403, Technology and Society.

# Portfolio Summary:
For this project I wanted to show off my skills in three distinct areas, Software Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. I choose projects that I am proud of and that fully encompass each category. The complexity of each project differs but also shows how far I’ve come as a computer science professional. 

The first artifact is the most complex and shows off my skills in software engineering. It is something that I am most proud of because of its complexity and the fact that I had never worked in this space before. This artifact is an OpenGL project written in C++ that creates a 3D bookcase from my home office. It utilizes lighting and textures, and allows for the user to orbit around the object with the keyboard and mouse as well as switch perspective types on the fly. This project took many hours to complete and really highlights my skills when it comes to software engineering.

The second artifact is less complex from the point of coding, since there really isn’t any code, but more complex in theory as it dives deep into the Data Structure and Algorithm side of data management. This artifact goes into the benefit of using a Red-Black binary search tree algorithm and data structure to manage an online auctions inventory. In this artifact I go into detail on why this approach is better suited for this business when compared to a normal binary search tree or other possible search algorithms.

The third artifact is for databases, and because of this I wanted to go with something that I use in my professional life almost everyday. This is why I choose to use my final project from DAD-220. I knew I could enhance the complexity of this project and show off my skills in SQL since I am now very comfortable with this language. The enhancements in this artifact show that I can take strong basic concepts and improve upon them with more advanced techniques to achieve the desired goals while saving time in the real world.
